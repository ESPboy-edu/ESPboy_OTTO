# OttoDIY_mBlock_Extension
Mblock is a software that allows Programming in Scratch Language for robots,Release by MakeBlocks, inherited from Scratch 2.0 by MIT. Extension is a set of files that allows you to install blocks for different types of robots to compatible with mBlock Environment
Download and install mBlock Software: http://www.mblock.cc/software/mblock/mblock3/

## OttoDIY 
   A BiPedal Robot is very Fun and wonderful opensource project. http://www.ottodiy.com/
   You can build your own and teach your kids programming Scratch for Otto Robot using this Extension

## Getting Started Learning to Code with Scratch, Great Starting for Kids and Beginner
   Refer to Wiki Page: https://github.com/stembotvn/OttoDIY_mBlock_Extension/wiki 
   
   See video how to install Otto Extension in mBlock software

## How to calibration Otto Legs
As you know, it is difficult to install Servos with accurate angle home, So we need a tool to calibrate by software. 
From Version 3.5, We added calibration block and make Calibration demo program so Makers can easily calibrate even inside mBlock software via Serial port.

## Online Doccumentation for setup Open Classroom to teach kids coding Scratch for Otto
We are building the online doccument with SphinX docs via ReadtheDocs Platform. All in progress. 

http://ottolearning.rtfd.io/

The sourcecode of online doccument is host in github:

https://github.com/stembotvn/OttoLearning

Forked, build and make a pull request if you want to contribute with me to build the doccument if you familiar with Sphinx docs. 


### NOTE: Version 2.6 full all of functions only work in Arduino Mode of mBlock (code in Scratch, mBLock automatically generate to Arduino code)
Have Fun learning with Otto robot!

## THERE IS A BUG FOUND WITH EXTENSION IN MBLOCK, IF YOU NEED TO SWITCH OVER EXTENSION OF MANY EXTENSIONS, PLEASE CLEAR CACHE IN MANAGE EXTENSION FIRST FOR WORKING WELL WITH MY EXTENSION
